## Themes
You can write a **CSS** script and save it as `user.css` in the project directory to change how the WebUI looks.
There are also pre-made themes available online, such as [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/stable-diffusion-webui).

## Default Values
Inside your WebUI installation folder, there is a file called `ui-config.json`.
You can edit this file to change the default UI values, such as `Sampling method`, disable unused elements, or increase the max resolution limits.
This can save you a few clicks every time you use the WebUI.
